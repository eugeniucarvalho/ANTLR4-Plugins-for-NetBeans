OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=ANTLR v4 syntax coloring for NetBeans 8.2
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    ANTLR v4 grammar file lexer based on ANTLR 4.5.3 used by ANTLR grammar file syntax coloring editor.\n\n\
    The coloring is not done in a pure lexical-based way but rather in a mixture of lexica-based and syntactic-based technics. \
    It enables to recognize (and coloring) some ANTLR syntactic items that a pure lexical parser (a lexer) is unable to do.

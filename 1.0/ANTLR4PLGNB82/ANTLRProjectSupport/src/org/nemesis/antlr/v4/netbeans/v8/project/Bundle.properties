OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    Currently, this module only supports Java Standard Edition projects. \
    It may seem restrictive but in fact it is the best way to develop with a parser generator:\n1\u00b0) you develop and debug your grammar as a library project. \
    So you have all the tools that enable to do such a task efficiently,\n2\u00b0) you use that library in another project specific to your purpose (Java standard Edition application or Java Enterprise Edition application project).\n\n\
    The integration is only done for the next project build tools:\n- ant (tested on release 1.9.4 but should work on all release higher than 1.8.0),\n- Maven (tested on release 3.0.5 but should work on all release higher than 3.0).
